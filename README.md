config-files
============

This repo contains configuration files for some common applications and
utilities that I use; it mostly consists of dot files for utilities like
`git`, `bash`, *etc.*.

Usage
=====

The `Symlink.sh` file is a bash script that symlinks all of the
configuration files in this repository into their proper location (at
least on a Mac operating system). It can be run from the command line
with `./Symlink.sh`.
