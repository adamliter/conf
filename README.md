dotfiles
========

This repo contains dot files for some common utilities that I use, like `git`, `bash`, etc..

Usage
=====

The `symlink.command` file is a bash script that symlinks all of the dot files in this repository into the `$HOME` directory. If on a Mac, one can just double click the file from inside a Finder window. Otherwise, it can be run from the command line, too, with `cd dotfiles && ./symlink.command`.
