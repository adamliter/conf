config-files
============

This repo contains configuration files for some common applications and utilities that I use; it mostly consists of dot files for utilities like `git`, `bash`, *etc.*.

Usage
=====

The `symlink.command` file is a bash script that symlinks all of the configuration files in this repository into their proper location (at least on a Mac operating system). On a Mac, one can just double click the file from inside a Finder window. Otherwise, it can be run from the command line, too, with `cd config-files && ./symlink.command`.
